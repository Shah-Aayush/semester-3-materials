/*
Variables : 
	-> Variables names are the placeholders for representing the data.
Data Types : 
	-> A data type in a programming language is a det of data with the values having predefined characteristics.
	-> System/Compiler defined data types are called PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES.
	-> Structures in C/C++ and classes in C++/JAVA are the means to create out own data types known as USER DEFINED DATA TYPES. 
Data Structure :
	-> Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
Classification : 
	-> LINEAR Data Structure (Link list, stack , queue)
	-> NON LINEAR Data Structure (tree, graph)
Abstract Data Type :
	-> All primitive data types supports basic operations like addition, substraction, etc.
	-> The system is providing the implementation for the primitive data types.
	-> For non primitive data tyeps we also need to define operations.
	-> Combination of data structure and their operations are known as ABSTRACT Data Type.	
ADT (Abstract Data Type) :
	-> So data structure is all about creating abstract data type.
	-> Any piece of information can be handled by defining appropriate data type and set of possible operations.
