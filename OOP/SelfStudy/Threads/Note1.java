Threads
	->What is thread 
		-A thread is an independent path of execution within a prgram.
		-Many threads can run concurrently within a program.
		-Multithreading refers to two or more tasks executing concurrently withing a single program.
		
	-ALU : Arithmetic Logic Unit [: which is present in processor	]
	
	-=>From too many programs, OS has only one ALU so it has to manage that. joining threads of processor to one of the program is work of the OS and it will do it in queue.
	-This joining can be in cycle which means every program will get its turn very fastly and repeatedly.
	
	->Thread class
		-Every thread in java is created and controlled by the java.lang.Thread class
		
		-Program should be given to Every thread after making one or more thread objects.
		
	-IMPLEMENTATION 
	->Creating thread
		-There are two ways to create thread in java :
			1.Implement the Runnable interface	[java.lang.Runnable]
			2.By extending the thread class		[java.lang.Thread]
