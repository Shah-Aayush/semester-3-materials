//		here we are using Constructor so we put () at the end.
//		Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object. A constructor resembles an instance method in java but it’s not a method as it doesn’t have a return type. In short constructor and method are different(More on this at the end of this guide). People often refer constructor as special type of method in Java.

//				Constructor has same name as the class and looks like this in a java code.
//
//				public class MyClass{
//				   //This is the constructor
//				   MyClass(){
//				   }
//				   ..
//				}
//		the constructor name matches with the class name and it doesn’t have a return type.
