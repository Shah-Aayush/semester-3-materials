//in bits column 1st bit is represented for + or - .here 1 for negative and 0 for positive.
//1 byte = 8 bit = 2^8 spaces
//1 bit = 2 space 
//int = 4 bytes
//short = 2 bytes
//long = 8 bytes
//class naming is camelclass -no gap btw two words-every first letter is capital like DataTypesTutorial
//also for variable name use above method but first letter is small of every variable name
