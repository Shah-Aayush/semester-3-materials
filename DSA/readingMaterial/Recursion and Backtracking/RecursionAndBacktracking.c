/*
	RECURSION AND BACKTRACKING 
		
	->Recursion
		-Any function which calls itself is called recursive.
		-A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.
		-It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates
		-Each time the function call itself with a slightly simpler version of the original problem.
	
	->Why recursion?
		-Recursive code is generally shorter and easier to write than iterative code.
	
	->Recursion
		-It terminates when a base case is reached.
		-Each recursive call requires extra space on the stack frame (i.e.Memory)
		-Solution to some problems are easier to formulate recursively.
		-FUNCTION CALLING ITSELF IS CALLED RECURSION.
		
	->Application of recursion
		-Fibonacci series
		-Factorial of a number
		-Merge sort, quick sort
		-Binary search
		-Tree traversal
		-Graph traversal (DFS, BFS)
		-Dynamic programming
		-Divide and conquer Algo.
		-Tower of Hanoi
		-Backtrackign algo.
	
	->BACKTRACKING 
		-Backtracking is the method of exhausted search using divide and conquer
		-Sometimes the best algorithm for a problem is to try all possiblities
		-This is always slow.
		
	->Recursion problem : 
		-tower of hanoi
		-Factorial
		-Fibonacci series
		-Greatest Common Divisor
		-Printing all permutation of given string 
		-Generate all String of n bits of binary digits
		-Define power function, which could handle negative powers
		-Write a recursive function to print entered characters in reverese order (TNRN)
		-Write a recursive function to convert decimal to binbary.
