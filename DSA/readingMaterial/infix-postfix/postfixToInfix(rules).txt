Algorithm POSTFIX : this alogrithm finds the value of an arithmetic expression P written in Postfix notation
	1. [ADD SENTINEL] Add a right parenthesis ')' at the end of P.
	2. [LOOP] Scan P from Left to Right and repeat steps 3 and 4 for each element of P until the sentinel ')' is encountered.
	3. [HANDLING OF OPERANDS] If an operand is encountered, put it on STACK.
	4. [HANDLING OF OPERATORS] If an operator '@' is encountered then 
		a. Remove the two top elements of STACK, where A is the top element and B is the next to top element.
		b. Evaluate B '@' A
		c. Place the result of B '@' A back on STACK.
			[End Of If Structure]
			[End Of Step 2 Loop]
	5. [RESULT] Set VALUE equal to the top element on STACK.
	6. [FINISHED] Exit.
