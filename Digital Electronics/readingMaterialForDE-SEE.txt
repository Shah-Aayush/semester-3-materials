Maximum possible min terms and max terms = 2^n
Total number of logical expressions : 2^[2^(n)]		[n = no. of variables]
Max Self dual possible for n variables : 2^[2^(n-1)]
m = no. of switches , n = no. of combinations : 2^m = n.
implicants = group of 1s
prime implicants = Largest group of 1s
Essential prime implicants = prime implicants with atleast 1 minterm which cannot be combined in anyother way.
r's complement of any number: (r^n)-N	[n = number of digits, N = given number , r = base]
(r-1)'s complement of any number: (r^n)-N-1	[n = number of digits, N = given number , r = base]
[(r-1)'s complement] + 1 = [r's complement]
