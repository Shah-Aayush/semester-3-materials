Given S is the Signal Rate, N is the Data Rate (bps)
S = N / r
3 cases are possible:
c is case factor, which varies for the best, average and worst cases
Best case - we need minimum signal rate
Average case – we are interested in
Worst case – we need maximum signal rate
Signal rate (average) = c X N X (1/r) baud
c = 1/2 for the avg. case as worst case is 1 and best case is 0

Minimum Bandwidth can be given as – Bmin = c X N X (1/r)
Maximum data rate is - Nmax = (1/c) X B X r
average signal rate = minimum bandwidth 

NRZ-L and NRZ-I both have an average signal rate of N/2 Bd.

NRZ-I if one comes then change the previous position in graph. same funda in differential manchester.

Group m data elements to produce a combination of 2m data patterns
If 2m = Ln, each data pattern is encoded in one signal pattern
If 2m < Ln, data patterns occupy only a subset of signal patterns
Data encoding is not possible if If 2m > Ln, because some data patterns cannot be encoded.

Codes are classified as mBnL
m is length of binary pattern
B means binary data
n is length of signal pattern
L is number of levels in the signalling
2B1Q – two binary, one quaternary
8B6T – eight binary, six ternary
4D – PAM5 – four-dimensional five level pulse amplitude modulation
Number of data patterns = 2^m
signal patterns possible = L^n
Redundant signals = L^n-2^m
r = m/L

Nyquist Theorem
To reproduce the original analog signal, one necessary condition is that the sampling rate be at least twice the highest frequency in the original signal

Minimum sampling rate for low-pass = 2*bandwidth
Minimum sampling rate for low-pass = cannot find. because we do not know where the bandwidth starts or ends. We do not know the maximum frequency in the signal.

zone width / height [TRIANGLE] ∆ = = (max - min)/L
Normalized PAM values = actual amplitudes / ∆
Normalized Quantized values = (mid point amplitude in each zone) / ∆ 
Normalized error = Normalized Quantized values – Normalized PAM values
 Quantization code – is based on the quantization levels at the left of the graph
Encoded works – final products of the conversion

SNRdb = 6.02 nb + 1.76 dB
Nb = log 2 L

Bit rate = sampling rate X number of bits per sample
Bit rate N = fs x nb
sampling rate = 2*maxFrequency./2*Banalog

Minimum bandwidth of a line-encoded signal : Bmin = nb X Banalog
Minimum bandwidth of digital signal is nb times greater than the bandwidth of the analog signal

Hence, the maximum bandwidth is Nmax = 2 X B X log 2 L 		bps
Minimum Required Bandwidth Bmin = N /(2 X log2L)		Hz
